The Central Processing Module is a critical backbone of the Whale Sentinel (WS) security framework, serving as the primary communication bridge between Agents and the WS Services. This module plays a dual role in facilitating secure interaction while ensuring system integrity and real-time responsiveness.

Key Functions:

✅ Request Handling & Analysis – It efficiently receives, validates, and routes incoming requests from Agents, ensuring that user-requested data is properly processed for security analysis.

✅ Active Profile Management – It enables Agents to dynamically load, retrieve, and update active profiles, ensuring real-time adaptability based on changing security conditions.

✅ Secure Communication Gateway – Acting as a trusted intermediary, this module enforces authentication, validates request formats, and ensures encrypted transmission between components to maintain data integrity.

✅ System Synchronization & Intelligence – By continuously syncing profile statuses and security configurations, it supports a proactive security posture, allowing seamless coordination between Agents and the WS system.
